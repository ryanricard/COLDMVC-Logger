####A logging plugin for ColdMVC

#####Usage:

Download the Logger plugin for ColdMVC and put it inside your _/plugins_ folder. Name the directory however you like; to reduce possible conflict, I suggest namespacing it _/com-ryanricard-logger_.

Update your app's _/config/plugins.cfm_ with the following.

	<cfset add("com-ryanricard-logger") />
